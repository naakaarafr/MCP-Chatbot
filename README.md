GitHub Repository: https://github.com/naakaarafr/MCP-Chatbot

A powerful chatbot built with Model Context Protocol (MCP) that provides intelligent automation through browser control, web search, and travel planning capabilities.

## Overview

This chatbot leverages the Model Context Protocol to integrate multiple specialized servers, creating a unified interface for web automation, search, and travel-related tasks. It uses Google's Gemini model as the underlying LLM and can gracefully handle server failures by testing each MCP server individually.

## Features

### üåê Browser Automation (Playwright MCP)
- Navigate to websites
- Take screenshots
- Click elements and interact with web pages
- Automate web-based tasks

### üîç Web Search (DuckDuckGo MCP)
- Perform web searches
- Get real-time information
- Research topics and find answers

### üè† Travel Planning (Airbnb MCP)
- Search for accommodations
- Find hotels and rentals
- Get travel recommendations

### üõ°Ô∏è Robust Error Handling
- Individual server testing on startup
- Graceful degradation when servers fail
- Fallback responses in limited mode
- Clear error reporting

## Prerequisites

### System Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Node.js and npm (for MCP servers)
- UV package manager (for Python MCP servers)

### Required Packages
```bash
# Python dependencies
pip install asyncio python-dotenv langchain-google-genai mcp-use

# Node.js MCP servers
npm install -g @playwright/mcp
npm install -g @openbnb/mcp-server-airbnb

# Python MCP servers
uvx install duckduckgo-mcp-server
```

## Installation

1. **Clone or download the project files:**
   ```bash
   # Ensure you have both app.py and browser_mcp.json
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or install individually:
   ```bash
   pip install asyncio python-dotenv langchain-google-genai mcp-use
   ```

3. **Install MCP servers:**
   ```bash
   # Playwright for browser automation
   npm install -g @playwright/mcp
   
   # Airbnb for travel search
   npm install -g @openbnb/mcp-server-airbnb
   
   # DuckDuckGo for web search
   uvx install duckduckgo-mcp-server
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables:**
   Create a `.env` file in the project root:
   ```env
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
   ```

5. **Configure MCP servers:**
   The `browser_mcp.json` file is already configured with default settings. Modify if needed:
   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "playwright": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["@playwright/mcp@latest"]
       },
       "airbnb": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@openbnb/mcp-server-airbnb"]
       },
       "ddg-search": {
         "command": "uvx",
         "args": ["duckduckgo-mcp-server"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Chatbot
```bash
python app.py
```

### Available Commands
- `help` - Show available commands and example queries
- `tools` - List all available MCP tools
- `quit` or `exit` - End the conversation

### Example Queries

#### Browser Automation
```
"Take a screenshot of google.com"
"Navigate to wikipedia.org and search for Python"
"Click the login button on the website"
```

#### Web Search
```
"What's the weather like today?"
"Search for the latest news about AI"
"Find information about renewable energy"
```

#### Travel Planning
```
"Find hotels in New York City"
"Search for Airbnb rentals in San Francisco"
"What are the best accommodations in Tokyo?"
```

#### General Assistance
```
"Find the best restaurants in downtown Chicago"
"Help me research Python programming tutorials"
"Take a screenshot of the current stock market trends"
```

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **MCPChatbot Class**: Main chatbot orchestrator
   - Initializes and manages MCP servers
   - Handles user interactions
   - Provides fallback responses

2. **Server Testing**: Individual server validation
   - Tests each MCP server on startup
   - Reports working and failed servers
   - Continues operation with available servers

3. **Agent Integration**: LangChain + MCP integration
   - Uses Google Gemini 2.0 Flash as the LLM
   - Integrates with MCP client for tool access
   - Supports up to 20 reasoning steps

### Error Handling

The chatbot implements robust error handling:
- **Server Failures**: Individual server testing prevents total failure
- **Limited Mode**: Provides basic responses when no servers are available
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation with partial functionality
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and status reporting

## Configuration

### MCP Server Configuration
Edit `browser_mcp.json` to add or modify MCP servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "your-server-name": {
      "command": "command-to-run",
      "args": ["arg1", "arg2"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables
Required in `.env` file:
- `GOOGLE_API_KEY`: Your Google AI API key for Gemini access

### LLM Configuration
Modify in `app.py` if needed:
```python
self.llm = ChatGoogleGenerativeAI(
    model="gemini-2.0-flash-exp",  # Model selection
    temperature=0.3                # Creativity level
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"browser_mcp.json not found"**
   - Ensure the configuration file is in the same directory as `app.py`

2. **"No MCP servers are working"**
   - Check that all MCP servers are properly installed
   - Verify Node.js and UV are installed and accessible
   - Check server logs for specific error messages

3. **Google API Key Issues**
   - Ensure your `.env` file contains a valid `GOOGLE_API_KEY`
   - Verify the API key has access to Gemini models

4. **Installation Issues**
   - Make sure Node.js and npm are installed
   - Install UV package manager: `pip install uv`
   - Try installing MCP servers individually to isolate issues

### Debug Mode
The chatbot provides detailed startup information:
- Server testing results
- Working server list
- Error messages for failed servers
